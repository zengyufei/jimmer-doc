The save command is used to store data structures of any complexity. To facilitate discussion, we need to establish a basic classification of data structure shapes.

## Entity Definition

Jimmer entities support two types of property representation:

- `@Id`: A property that must be defined for any Jimmer entity type. It serves as a technical unique identifier, known in the industry as a `Surrogate Id`.

- [@Key](../../mapping/advanced/key): Multiple properties that Jimmer recommends defining for entity types. They serve as business-level unique identifiers, known in the industry as `Natural Id`.

In this series of articles, all entities have both `@Id` and `@Key` properties defined, with the Id property using the database's auto-increment strategy. Here's an example using `Book`:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java"
@Entity
public interface Book {

    @Id ❶
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) ❷
    long id();

    @Key ❸
    String name();
    
    @Key ❸
    int edition();

    BigDecimal price();

    ...other properties omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    @Id ❶
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) ❷
    val id: Long

    @Key ❸
    val name: String
    
    @Key ❸
    val edition: Int

    val price: BigDecimal

    ...other properties omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- ❶ Id property, i.e., Surrogate Id
- ❷ Id property uses database auto-numbering as the auto-increment strategy
- ❸ Key property, i.e., Natural Id

## Data Classification

### 1. Wild Objects

An object is called a wild object if neither its `@Id` property *(Book.id in this article)* nor its `@Key` properties *(Book.name and Book.edition in this article)* are specified. For example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
Book book = Immutables.createBook(draft -> {
    draft.setPrice(new BigDecimal("59.9"));
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val book = Book {
    price = BigDecimal("59.9")
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When we say `@Key` properties are not specified, this includes two situations:

- The entity type doesn't define any `@Key` properties *(not discussed in this article)*
- Although the entity type defines `@Key` properties, these properties are not specified in the object

:::caution
Jimmer does not recommend wild objects. Although API parameters can be adjusted to save wild objects, this will ultimately compromise idempotency.
:::

### 2. Id-specified Objects

An object is called an id-specified object if its `@Id` property *(Book.id in this article)* is specified. For example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
Book book = Immutables.createBook(draft -> {
    draft.setId(17L);
    ...other settings omitted...
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val book = Book {
    id = 17L
    ...other settings omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Jimmer supports `UPSERT` operations, where users don't explicitly specify `insert` or `update`, letting Jimmer make the determination.

When saving an id-specified object in `UPSERT` mode, Jimmer uses the `@Id` property to determine whether corresponding data already exists in the database, ultimately deciding whether to insert or update.

### 3. Key-specified Objects

An object is called a key-specified object if its `@Id` property *(Book.id in this article)* is not specified, but its `@Key` properties *(Book.name and Book.edition in this article)* are specified. For example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
Book book = Immutables.createBook(draft -> {
    draft.setName("GraphQL in Action");
    draft.setEdition(2);
    ...setting other properties except id...
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val book = Book {
    name = "GraphQL in Action"
    edition = 1
    ...setting other properties except id...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
In the code above, the omitted parts do not include setting the `@Id` property, because once the `@Id` property is set, it should be an id-specified object, not a key-specified object.

### 4. Id-only Objects

An id-specified object is called an id-only object if no properties other than id are specified. For example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
Book book = Immutables.createBook(draft -> {
    draft.setId(17L);
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val book = Book {
    id = 17L
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In hierarchical data structures, any object can have deeper associated objects.

If an associated object is an id-only object, it indicates that only the association relationship is being modified, without further creating or modifying the associated object.

### 5. Key-only Objects

A key-specified object is called a key-only object if no properties other than key properties are specified. For example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
Book book = Immutables.createBook(draft -> {
    draft.setName("GraphQL in Action");
    draft.setEdition(2);
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val book = Book {
    name = "GraphQL in Action"
    edition = 1
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In hierarchical data structures, any object can have deeper associated objects.

If an associated object is a key-only object, it indicates that only the association relationship is being modified, without further creating or modifying the associated object.
