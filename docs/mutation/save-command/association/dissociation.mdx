When saving associated objects using the association mode `AssociatedSaveMode.REPLACE`, 
there is an important concept: dissociation operation.

## Concept

<Dissociate/>

Dissociation applies to two types of associations:

-   Middle table associations

    Obviously, middle table associations refer to associations like `Book.authors` and `Author.books` in this tutorial.
    
    Their dissociation operation is very simple, just deleting the association in the middle table, without affecting the associated objects themselves.

-   Child table associations

    Child table associations refer to inverse associations based on foreign keys *(whether real or fake)*, such as `BookStore.books` in this tutorial.

    Their dissociation operation is relatively complex. Developers can control specific dissociation behavior through configuration.

Next, let's discuss these two types of dissociation operations.

## Dissociating Middle Table Associations

We've already demonstrated this simplest form of dissociation when introducing the [REPLACE](./associated-save-mode#5-replace) save mode for associated objects.

Therefore, we won't repeat it here.

## Dissociating Child Table Associations

Child table associations refer to inverse associations based on foreign keys *(whether real or fake)*, such as `BookStore.books`.

Their dissociation operation is relatively complex. Developers can configure the dissociation mode for properties corresponding to foreign keys *(such as `Book.store` here)* to achieve different dissociation behaviors.

### Dissociation Modes

<DissociateMode/>

There are two ways to configure dissociation mode:

-   Static configuration using annotations on entities, which is global.

-   Dynamic configuration in code, which can override static configuration but only affects the current save command.

Taking `SET_NULL` as an example:

-   Static entity-based configuration *(chosen in most cases, used by the majority of business logic)*

### Save Code

Next, let's explain various dissociation modes through saving data structures containing one-to-many association `BookStore.books`.

Here's the save code:

            book.setName("Learning GraphQL");
            book.setEdition(3);
            book.setPrice(new BigDecimal("51.9"));
        });
        draft.addIntoBooks(book -> {

:::info
Among them, the 8 associated objects that are no longer needed, i.e., the 8 objects that need to be dissociated, are highlighted.

So, how will Jimmer dissociate these associated objects?

In fact, different dissociation configurations will lead to different dissociation behaviors.
:::

### 1. NONE *(Default)*

NONE's behavior is not fixed, but depends on the global configuration `jimmer.default-dissociate-action-check`:

- If `jimmer.default-dissociate-action-check` is true *(default)* or if the current association is based on a real foreign key *(foreign key constraint exists in database, see [Real vs Fake Foreign Keys](../../../mapping/base/foreignkey))*, treated as [CHECK](#3-check).

- If `jimmer.default-dissociate-action-check` is false and the current association is based on a fake foreign key (no corresponding foreign key constraint in database, see [Real vs Fake Foreign Keys](../../../mapping/base/foreignkey)), treated as [LAX](#2-lax).

### 2. LAX

- Dissociate mode `LAX` means the dissociation operation does nothing.

- Associated save mode `AssociatedSaveMode.REPLACE` means unnecessary associations need to be discarded.

Clearly, these two rules conflict. In this case, `AssociatedSaveMode.REPLACE` takes precedence, `LAX` is ignored, and it's ultimately treated as [CHECK](#3-check).

Therefore, we cannot demonstrate `LAX` through this article. To understand how `LAX` works, please see [Delete Command](../../delete-command).

### 3. CHECK

`CHECK` mode does not allow dissociating associated objects. Jimmer will check if there are objects that need to be dissociated, and if they exist, throws an exception.

The dissociate mode can be set either through the entity definition or through the save command.

Here, we set the dissociate mode for `Book.store` through entity configuration:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java"
@Entity
@KeyUniqueConstraint(noMoreUniqueConstraints = true)
public interface Book {

    //highlight-next-line
    @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.CHECK)
    @Nullable
    @ManyToOne
    BookStore store();

    ...omitted other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin  title="Book.kt"
@Entity
@KeyUniqueConstraint(noMoreUniqueConstraints = true)
interface Book {

    //highlight-next-line
    @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.CHECK)
    @ManyToOne
    val store: BookStore?

    ...omitted other code...        
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To demonstrate simpler SQL generation, let's assume `sqlClient`'s `targetTransferable` feature is enabled, which was previously discussed, see [here](./owner#2-配置是否允许不同父对象抢夺子对象)

Running the save code from before will generate three SQL statements:

1. <MergeRoots/>

2. <MergeAssociations/>

3. Check if there are objects that need to be dissociated *(if any exist, throws exception to prevent save command)*

    ```csharp
    select
        tb_1_.ID
    from BOOK tb_1_
    where
        tb_1_.STORE_ID in (
            ? /* 1 */, ? /* 2 */
        )
    and
        (tb_1_.STORE_ID, tb_1_.ID) not in (
            (? /* 1 */, ? /* 3 */), 
            (? /* 1 */, ? /* 100 */), 
            (? /* 1 */, ? /* 6 */), 
            (? /* 1 */, ? /* 101 */), 
            (? /* 1 */, ? /* 9 */), 
            (? /* 1 */, ? /* 102 */), 
            (? /* 2 */, ? /* 12 */), 
            (? /* 2 */, ? /* 103 */)
        )
    limit ? /* 1 */
    ```

    After this SQL check, some `Book` objects that will be dissociated are found through the saved `BookStore` objects' `Book.authors` property. However, they do not agree to be dissociated and throw the following exception:

    ```sh
    Save error caused by the path: "<root>.books": 
    #highlight-next-line
    Cannot dissociate child objects 
    because the 
    dissociation action of the many-to-one property 
    "com.yourcommany.yourproject.model.Book.store" 
    is not configured as "set null" or "cascade". 
    There are two ways to resolve this issue: 
    Decorate the many-to-one property 
    "com.yourcommany.yourproject.model.Bookstore" by 
    @org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.OnDissociate whose argument 
    is `DissociateAction.SET_NULL` or `DissociateAction.DELETE`, 
    or use save command's runtime configuration to override it
    ```

### 4. SET_NULL

`SET_NULL` mode achieves dissociation by setting the associated object's foreign key property to null.

:::caution
`SET_NULL` mode requires that the foreign key-based property *(here `Book.store`)* must be nullable, otherwise it will cause a compilation error
:::

The dissociate mode can be set either through the entity definition or through the save command.

Here, we set the dissociate mode for `Book.store` through entity configuration:

    We can see significant differences between databases:

    - `H2` and `Postgres` use batched simple SQL
    - `MySQL` uses a single complex SQL

    :::info
    This is because `H2` and `Postgres` support the `=any(array)` syntax, while MySQL does not.
    :::

### 5. DELETE

`DELETE` mode achieves dissociation by deleting the associated objects.

:::info
Here when saving `BookStore`, we perform dissociation on the `BookStore.books` association, where `DELETE` mode indicates we want to delete unnecessary `Book` objects.

However, since the `Book` entity has a deeper association `Book.authors`, we need to consider how to dissociate `Author` objects before deleting `Book` objects.

In fact, if objects that need to be deleted due to dissociation have deeper associations, it evolves into a recursive deletion problem.
This behavior is detailed in [Delete Command](../../delete-command), which we won't discuss here.

Therefore, to simplify the discussion, we'll temporarily ignore the `Author` entity and assume the current system only has `BookStore` and `Book` entity types.
:::

The dissociate mode can be set either through the entity definition or through the save command.

Here, we set the dissociate mode for `Book.store` through entity configuration:
