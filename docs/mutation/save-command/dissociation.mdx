An important concept is involved when saving associated objects: dissociation operations.

## Concept

Consider the following example:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Existing data structure in database</th>
<th>Data structure user wants to save</th> 
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

```sh 
+-Food
|
|
|
# highlight-next-line
+-----Meat(Ignore child nodes)
|
\-----Bread(Ignore child nodes)
```

</td>
<td>

```sh
+-Food
|
+-----Drinks(Ignore child nodes)
|
|
|
\-----Bread(Ignore child nodes)
```

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

-   For `Bread`, it exists in both old and new data structures, corresponding to update operation

-   For `Drinks`, it does not exist in the old data structure, but exists in the new data, corresponding to INSERT operation

-   For `Meat`, it exists in the old data structure, but does not exist in the new data, the corresponding operation is called dissociation operation.

Dissociation applies to two types of data:

-   Middle table data

-   Child table data

Next, we discuss these two dissociation operations.

:::info
To simplify the generated SQL as much as possible, let us focus on the association itself and dissociation operations in this article:

-   All saved objects specify only the id property *(short association)*

-   The save mode of the aggregated root object is explicitly specified as UPDATE_ONLY *(This article uses the syntax of calling the `update` method)*
:::

## Dissociating Middle Table Data

There is a many-to-many association between the `BOOK` table and the `AUTHOR` table, with middle table `BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING`.

The `Book.authors` and `Author.books` properties both map this many-to-many association and are mirrors of each other. Using either can demonstrate the effect. Here we choose `Book.authors`.

First query the database to see which `Author` objects id=3 `Book` corresponds to: 

```sql
select *  
from book_author_mapping
where book_id = 3;
```

The query result is:

|book_id|author_id|
|-|-|
|3|1|
|3|2|

Now update this `Book` object:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java 
sqlClient.update(
    Immutables.createBook(draft -> {
        draft.setId(3L);
        draft.addIntoAuthors(author -> author.setId(2L));
        draft.addIntoAuthors(author -> author.setId(5L));
    })
);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
sqlClient.update(
    Book {
        id = 3L
        authors().addBy { id = 2L } 
        authors().addBy { id = 3L }
    }
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The comparison of old and new data structures is:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Existing data structure in database</th>
<th>Data structure user wants to save</th>
</tr>  
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr> 
<td>

```sh  
+-Book(id=3)
| 
# highlight-next-line
+-----Author(id=1)
|
\-----Author(id=2)


```

</td>
<td>

```sh
+-Book(id=3)
|
|
|
+-----Author(id=2)
|
\-----Author(id=5) 
```

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This means:

-   The association between `Book-3` and `Author-2` remains unchanged

-   The association between `Book-3` and `Author-5` needs to be created

-   The association between `Book-3` and `Author-1` needs to be deleted, which is the dissociation operation

Finally 3 SQL statements are generated:

1.  Query which `Author` objects `Book-3` corresponds to

    ```sql
    select 
        AUTHOR_ID  
    from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING 
    where
        BOOK_ID = ? /* 3 */
    ```

2.  **Dissociation operation, detach association between `Book-3` and `Author-1`**  

    ```sql
    /* highlight-next-line */
    delete from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING  
    where
        (BOOK_ID, AUTHOR_ID) in (
            (? /* 3 */, ? /* 1 */)
        )
    ```
    :::info
    This is the deassociation operation we want on the middle table
    :::
    
3.  Create association between `Book-3` and `Author-5`

    ```sql
    insert into BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING(
        BOOK_ID, AUTHOR_ID 
    )
    values
        (? /* 3 */, ? /* 5 */)
    ```

## Dissociating Child Table Data  

This operation is for associations directly based on foreign keys.

The `BOOK` table has a foreign key field `STORE_ID` pointing to the `BOOK_STORE` table, forming a many-to-one association. This many-to-one association is mapped to the `Book.store` property, and the reverse one-to-many association is mapped to the `BookStore.books` property.

If a parent object in the database *(`BookStore` in this example)* holds some child objects *(`Book` in this example)*, but the overwritten parent object is no longer expected to continue holding some child objects, it will cause those child objects to be dissociated.

### Dissociation Modes

<DissociateMode/>

:::info
Although child object dissociation is caused by a one-to-many association *(i.e. parent object abandoning some child objects, the one-to-many association is `BookStore.books` in this example)*, the dissociation mode is configured for the reverse many-to-one association *(`Book.store` in this example)*. The purpose of this design is to maintain similarity with configuring cascade behaviors of foreign keys in database DDL. 

For Jimmer, a one-to-many association must be bidirectional, so once a one-to-many association is known, its mirroring many-to-one association must also be known. So there is no problem with this design.  
:::

There are two ways to configure the dissociation mode:

-   Static configuration on entity with annotation, static configuration is global.

-   Dynamic configuration in code, dynamic configuration only affects the current save command, and it can override static configuration.

Take `SET_NULL` as an example:

-   Static configuration *(default configuration, for the vast majority of business uses)*:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Book.java" 
    @Entity
    public interface Book {

        //highlight-next-line 
        @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.SET_NULL)  
        @Nullable
        @ManyToOne
        BookStore store();

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Book.kt"
    @Entity
    interface Book {

        //highlight-next-line
        @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.SET_NULL)
        @ManyToOne  
        val store: BookStore?

        ...other code omitted...       
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

-   Runtime override *(only for a single save command, used by very few business cases with special needs)*:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java 
    sqlClient
        .getEntities()
        .saveCommand(book) 
        // highlight-next-line
        .setDissociateAction(BookProps.STORE, DissociateAction.SET_NULL)
        .execute();
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    sqlClient.save(book) {
        // highlight-next-line
        .setDissociateAction(Book::store, DissociateAction.SET_NULL) 
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

### Example  

First, query the database to see which `Book` objects id=2 `BookStore` holds:

```sql 
select *
from BOOK  
where STORE_ID = 2
```

The query result is:

|ID|NAME|EDITION|PRICE|STORE_ID|
|-|-|-|-|-| 
|12|GraphQL in Action|3|80.00|2|
|11|GraphQL in Action|2|81.00|2|
|10|GraphQL in Action|1|80.00|2|

As you can see, `BookStore-2` holds `Book-10`, `Book-11`, and `Book-12`.

Now, update this `BookStore` object:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
sqlClient.update(
    Immutables.createBookStore(draft -> {
        draft.setId(2L);
        draft.addIntoBooks(book -> book.setId(9L));
        draft.addIntoBooks(book -> book.setId(10L)); 
    })
);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin 
sqlClient.update(
    BookStore {
        id = 2L
        books().addBy { id = 9L }
        books().addBy { id = 10L }
    }
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The comparison of old and new data structures is:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Existing data structure in database</th>
<th>Data structure user wants to save</th>
</tr>
</thead>  
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

```sh
+-BookStore(id=2) 
|
+-----Book(id=10)
| 
# highlight-next-line
+-----Book(id=11)
|
# highlight-next-line
\-----Book(id=12)


```

</td>
<td>

```sh 
+-BookStore(id=2)
|
+-----Book(id=10)
|
|
|
|
|
\-----Book(id=9)
```

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This means:

-   The association between `BookStore-2` and `Book-10` remains unchanged

-   The association between `BookStore-2` and `Book-9` needs to be created  

-   `BookStore-2` needs to dissociate `Book-11` and `Book-12`.

    However, the SQL operations determined by the dissociation mode of the configuration of `Book.store` property is unknown.

Different dissociation mode configurations will lead to different execution logic. Next, we discuss the three cases of `NONE`, `SET_NULL` and `DELETE`.

-   `NONE` *(default)*:

    `NONE` means dissociation is not supported, the operation is prevented by throwing an exception which causes transaction rollback. So the above code will throw an exception.

    The exception type is `org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.runtime.SaveException`.

    The exception message is:

    > Save error caused by the path: "&lt;root&gt;.books": Cannot dissociate child objects because the dissociation action of the many-to-one property "com.yourcompany.yourproject.model.Book.store" is not configured as "set null" or "cascade". There are two ways to resolve this issue: Decorate the many-to-one property "com.yourcompany.yourproject.model.Book.store" by @org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.OnDissociate whose argument is `DissociateAction.SET_NULL` or `DissociateAction.DELETE` , or use save command's runtime configuration to override it
    
-   `SET_NULL`:

    In this mode, two SQL statements are generated:

    1.  Associate `BookStore-2` with `Book-9` and `Book-10`. For `Book-10` this is effectively no change.

        ```sql
        update BOOK  
        set
            STORE_ID = ? /* 2 */ 
        where
            ID in (
                ? /* 9 */, ? /* 10 */
            )
        ```

    2.  Set foreign key of all books belonging to `BookStore-2` whose id is not 9 or 10 *(`Book-11` and ``Book-11` in this example)* to empty. 

        ```sql
        update BOOK
        set
            STORE_ID = null
        where 
            STORE_ID = ? /* 2 */
            and 
            ID not in ( /* Note `not` */
                ? /* 9 */, ? /* 10 */
            )
        ```

        :::info
        Note the `not` in SQL, this is the deassociation operation on the child table for the `SET_NULL` mode. 
        :::
        
-   `DELETE`:

    In this mode, 4 SQL statements are generated:

    1.  Associate `BookStore-2` with `Book-9` and `Book-10`. For `Book-10` this is effectively no change.

        ```sql
        update BOOK
        set
            STORE_ID = ? /* 2 */
        where
            ID in (
                ? /* 9 */, ? /* 10 */  
            )
        ```

    2.  Query all books belonging to `BookStore-2` whose id is not 9 or 10. For this example, the query result is `Book-11` and ``Book-12`.

        ```sql
        select
            ID
        from BOOK
        where
            STORE_ID = ? /* 2 */
            and
            ID not in (
                ? /* 9 */, ? /* 10 */
            ) 
        ```
        
        :::note
        Note the `not` in the SQL
        :::

    3.  Before deleting `Book-11` and `Book-12`, first clean up their many-to-many associations with `Author` 

        ```sql
        delete from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING
        where
            BOOK_ID in (
                ? /* 11 */, ? /* 12 */
            )
        ```

        :::info
        If `Book` type has more other associations, Jimmer will clean them all up properly. It just means more SQL statements like this step.
        :::

    4.  Finally, safely delete `Book-11` and `Book-12` to complete the dissociation operation

        ```sql
        delete from BOOK
        where
            ID in (
                ? /* 11 */, ? /* 12 */
            )
        ```
        
    :::tip
    Step 3 and step 4 are a whole, they jointly form the deassociation operation. 

    In fact, this is the [Delete Command](../delete-command) that will be introduced in subsequent documentation. 
    :::
    
:::info  
This article simplifies the examples a lot, such as:

-   Explicitly specifying processing mode of aggregated root object as `UPDATE_ONLY` *(calling `update` instead of `save`)*

-   All associated objects are short associated objects with only id. In fact, you can arbitrarily change the format of associated objects, for example:

    -   Do not specify `id` property, but specify `key` property *(<ViewMore buttonText="Short Association"><ShortAssociation/></ViewMore> expressed in another way)*

    -   Specify `key` property and some properties that are neither `id` nor `key` *(<ViewMore buttonText="Long Association"><LongAssociation/></ViewMore>)* 
    
The examples are so simplified in this article just to keep the SQL generated by the save command as simple as possible for readers to quickly understand the characteristics of dissociation operations.

As for associated objects of more complex formats, readers can try it themselves, or refer directly to the official examples [jimmer-examples/java/save-command](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/tree/main/java/save-command) and [jimmer-examples/kotlin/save-command-kt](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/tree/main/kotlin/save-command-kt). These functionalities still exist, just with more generated SQL statements and more tedious hidden details.
