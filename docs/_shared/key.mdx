Initially, people used business fields directly as the primary key of tables. This is the most straightforward and easy to use approach, but it has the following problems:

-   Unstable primary key

    Since the primary key itself is a business field, it can be modified, which leads to an unstable primary key.

    Although the foreign keys that reference it in the database can use `on update cascade` to keep consistency, 
    an unstable primary key will cause many problems for systems outside the database, such as caches.

    Even if a unified solution to the primary key instability problem can be abstracted at the technical level, it is not recommended, because it makes the system difficult to understand.

-   High cost of multi-table joins

    Since the primary key itself is a business field, its type is likely to be a relatively long string type rather than a numeric type,
    and it may even be a composite primary key composed of multiple columns, which leads to high cost of multi-table joins.


To solve the above problems, people learned to use data without business meaning as the primary key, such as

-   Auto numbering by database
-   Sequence value by database
-   UUID
-   Snowflake ID

To enable idempotent saves for save commands, Jimmer introduces two concepts: Id and Key

-   @Id: Primary key

-   @Key: Business primary key

    -   If Id itself is a business attribute (not recommended), no need to specify Key, because Id itself already represents the uniqueness constraint at the business level.

    -   If Id has no business meaning (recommended), then Key represents what the uniqueness constraint is at the business level.

See the following example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Entity  
public interface TreeNode {

    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    long id();

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key
    String name();

    // highlight-next-line 
    @Key  
    @ManyToOne
    @Nullable
    TreeNode parent();

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent")
    List<TreeNode> childNodes();
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
@Entity
interface TreeNode {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) 
    val id: Long

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key
    val name: String

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key   
    @ManyToOne
    val parent: TreeNode?

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent")
    val childNodes: List<TreeNode>
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here, the Id of the `TreeNode` entity uses auto numbering and has no business meaning. Therefore, to better match save commands, 
`key` is specified here, consisting of two properties: `name` and `parent`.

The corresponding DDL is:

```csharp
create table TREE_NODE(
    ID bigint not null,
    NAME varchar(20) not null,
    PARENT_ID bigint
);

alter table TREE_NODE
    add constraint PK_TREE_NODE
        primary key(ID);
        
alter table TREE_NODE
    add constraint UQ_TREE_NODE
        /* highlight-next-line */
        unique(NAME, PARENT_ID); 
```

The `name` and `parent` properties of the entity type decorated with @Key correspond to the UNIQUE constraint *(or UNIQUE INDEX)* composed of the `NAME` and `PARENT_ID` columns in the database.

This uniqueness constraint can be analogized to file systems. File systems allow directories or files with the same name, but do not allow the same name if the parent directory is specified.

:::info
Through this example, we see:

-   Key can consist of multiple properties

-   Foreign keys can be part of Key

Let's take another look at another example where the properties that make up Key are all properties based on foreign keys:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Entity
public interface OrderItem {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)  
    long id();

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key   
    @ManyToOne
    Order order();

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key
    @ManyToOne
    Product product();

    int quantity();

    // Snapshot of `product.price`
    BigDecimal unitPrice(); 
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
@Entity
interface OrderItem {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    val id: Long

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key
    @ManyToOne
    val order: Order

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key 
    @ManyToOne
    val product: Product

    val quantity: Int

    // Snapshot of `product.price`
    val unitPrice: BigDecimal
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
