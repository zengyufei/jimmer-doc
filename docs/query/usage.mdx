## Select-After Style

Unlike native SQL, in the DSL provided by Jimmer, the `select` statement comes after `where`, `orderBy`, `groupBy`, `having`, etc. For example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable table = Tables.BOOK_TABLE;

List<Book> books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(table) ❶
    .where(table.name().eq("SQL in Action"))
    .orderBy(table.name().asc(), table.edition().desc())
    // highlight-next-line  
    .select(table) ❷
    .limit(10, 100)
    .execute(); ❸
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(Book::class) { ❶
        where(table.name eq "SQL in Action")
        orderBy(table.name.asc(), table.edition.desc())
        // highlight-next-line
        select(table) ❷
    }
    .limit(10, 100)
    .execute() ❸
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Putting `select` after is not invented by Jimmer. This style was first brought to mainstream by [LINQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) introduced in C# 3.5.  

This style has innate advantages for building strongly typed DSL frameworks, so Jimmer naturally adopts it.

## Code Structure

Now let's explain the code:

-   ❶ Create the query, get a mutable query object. Operations targeting this object continue until ❷.

    A mutable query object means any operations like `where`, `orderBy`, `groupBy`, `having` directly modify the current query object. 

-   ❷ Call `select`, convert the mutable query object into an immutable one. Operations targeting this object continue until ❸.

    An immutable query object means any operations like `distinct`, `limit`, `forUpdate`, `reselect`, `withoutSortingAndPaging`, `union`, `unionAll`, `minus`, `intersect`, do not change the current object but create a new one.

    For example *(to be concise, this pseudo-code uses Kotlin)*:
    ```kotlin
    val query = sqlClient.createQuery(Book::class) {
        where(...)
        orderBy(...)
        select(...)
    }
    val query1 = query.limit(10, 0); 
    val query2 = query.limit(10, 1);
    val query3 = query.limit(10, 2);
    ```
    Here `query` is the original query, `query1`, `query2`, `query3` are other queries created based on it. `limit` does not change `query` itself but creates new immutable query objects. 
    
    Finally, `query1`, `query2`, `query3` share the same filters, sorting and structure projection as `query`, only differing in paging range. They can coexist without interfering with each other.

    Also, the mutable query before `select` has no return type, while the immutable query after `select` has a return type. That is, `select` assigns the final return type to the query.

-   ❸ Call `execute` to execute the query and return data.  

    Before this step, no matter how the DSL is operated and tuned, no SQL operations will be executed.

    Besides `execute`, there are other methods to execute queries:

    -   `fetchOne`: Assume the query returns exactly one row, get that row. Throw exception if 0 or more rows are returned during actual execution.

    -   `fetchOneOrNull`: Assume the query returns 0 or 1 row, get that row or null. Throw exception if more rows are returned during actual execution.

    -   `fetchOptional`: Similar to `fetchOneOrNull` but returns `java.util.Optional<T>` instead of `null | T`.

        :::caution
        This API only exists in Java API, not in Kotlin API since Kotlin does not need `java.util.Optional<T>`.
        :::

    -   `map`: Execute directly and do an additional collection map operation at JVM level on top of the returned raw collection.

    -   `forEach`: If returning too much data to avoid materializing a large collection, `forEach` can be called with a callback to traverse all data.

        This is what people often refer to as cursor queries.

    -   `count`: Based on the original data query written by users, automatically generate the count aggregate query needed for paging, execute and get total rows before paging.  

        :::info
        This is a smart and advanced operation, please see [Paging](./paging).
        :::
    
    :::tip
    All the methods above to execute queries have two overloaded versions:

    -   Parameterless version *(as shown in the example)* utilizes Jimmer's connection management *(usually integrating with Spring transaction management)* to get JDBC connection and execute.

    -   Version with a parameter accepting a JDBC connection. In special cases developers can discard Jimmer's connection management *(usually integrating with Spring transaction management)* and execute on a specified JDBC connection.

Now the process can be summarized as:

```
+----------------------+ 
|    ❶ createQuery    |
+-----------+----------+
            |
     Mutable Query
(Operations like where, orderBy
directly modify the query)

            |
           \|/
+----------------------+
|     ❷ select        |
+-----------+----------+
            |
    Immutable Query 
(Operations like limit, distinct
create new queries without modifying current one)
            |
            |
           \|/
+----------------------+
| ❸ execute or others |
+-----------+----------+
            |
           \|/
     Execution Result
(Result type is specified by ❷ select)
```
