## Where are the Examples and Getting started?

When facing a new framework, the first reaction of developers is to look for examples and quick start guides.

- Examples: [Quick Preview/Standard Examples](../quick-view/standard-demo)

- Get started: [Quick Preview/Get Started](../quick-view/get-started/)

However, if you observe the documentation structure carefully, you will find that their positions in the directory structure are not particularly front. Why is that?

Because Jimmer is a revolutionary technology, providing a completely new technical solution at a time when developers thought the technology ecosystem for accessing RDBMS from the JVM was already solidified and couldn't possibly undergo a major transformation.
Therefore, it is necessary to first discuss these changes and clearly explain the incredible benefits they will bring to real-world projects.

This field already has a plethora of choices *(to the point of being over-served)*, and if the new technical solution's approach and methodology are similar to previous works, it would not bring about a ground-breaking change and cliff-like efficiency boost to real-world project development. Instead, it would simply be adding another choice to the already numerous choices.
In that case, there would be no need to develop an entirely new project, as it would only add confusion to the industry.

In summary, it is recommended to understand Jimmer's innovations and the significant benefits they will bring before looking at the standard examples and quick start guide; attempting to understand them with your previous path to success and psychological expectations may be counter-productive at first.

## About This Documentation

The chapters of this documentation are divided into two types:

- Tutorial chapters marked with a ★ symbol.

    1.  [Introduction/Overview](./introduction)

        The most important article, marked with a ✦ symbol.
        
        It discusses Jimmer's innovations, introduces all its features, and provides rich, concise demonstrations.

    2.  [Quick Preview](../quick-view/)

        A quick preview of Jimmer's three most basic introductory features:
        1. Querying any shape
        2. Saving any shape
        3. Arbitrary dynamic queries.

        > This chapter only includes these 3 core capabilities and does not cover other advanced features.

    3.  [Showcase](../showcase)

        For any framework, some features can be demonstrated with code and do not require extensive explanations to aid understanding.

        All such features that can be easily demonstrated with code and do not require much explanation are listed in this chapter.

- Other chapters.

    The remaining chapters should be treated as reference books, not tutorials.
    
    These chapters delve into the details of various features, including advanced ones.
