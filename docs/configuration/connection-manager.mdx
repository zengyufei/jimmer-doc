## Simple ConnectionManager

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
javax.sql.DataSource dataSource = ...;

JSqlClient sqlClient = JSqlClient
    .newBuilder()
    .setConnectionManager(
        ConnectionManager
        // highlight-next-line
        .simpleConnectionManager(dataSource)
    )
    .build(); 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val dataSource: javax.sql.DataSource = ...

val sqlClient = newKSqlClient {
    setConnectionManager {
        dataSource.connection.use {
            // highlight-next-line
            proceed(it)
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

However, transactions are very important in actual projects. Therefore, except for learning and trying, it is not recommended to use this approach in actual projects.
