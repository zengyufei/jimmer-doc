title: Association Cache

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { ViewMore } from '@site/src/components/ViewMore';
import {AssociationCache} from '@site/src/components/Image';

Association cache refers to mapping the current object id to the associated object id or collection.

<AssociationCache/>

Where:
-   `BookStore.books-*`: One-to-many association cache  
-   `Book.store-*`: Many-to-one association cache
-   `Book.authors-*`: Many-to-many association cache
-   `Author.books-*`: Many-to-many association cache  

:::caution
Unlike other association caches, there is one scenario that does not require using one-to-one or many-to-one association cache.

If a one-to-one or many-to-one association is based on a real foreign key with a corresponding foreign key constraint in the database, then the foreign key itself is the associated object id, and association cache is not required.

In other cases, Jimmer will use one-to-one or many-to-one association cache. These cases include:

-   The referenced association property is reverse side

    That is, `@OneToOne`'s `mappedBy` is configured.

-   The referenced association property is based on a pseudo foreign key

    A pseudo foreign key means that it is conceptually a foreign key in the developer's mind, but there is no corresponding foreign key constraint in the database.

    The pseudo foreign key field may contain illegal values, the non-null value does not mean the associated object exists, so association cache is required to filter out valid associated objects.
    
-   The referenced association property is based on a join table rather than a foreign key. 

-   When [implementing GraphQL with Jimmer](../../graphql), [Object Fetcher](../../query/object-fetcher) *(GraphQL and Object Fetchers are homogenous functions)* should not be used in aggregate root queries, 
    but object fetcher were incorrectly used in aggregate root queries to obtain objects without foreign keys. However, the GraphQL request body contains many-to-one associations.
:::

In the official sample code included, the many-to-one association `Book.store` is based on a real foreign key, so its many-to-one cache will not be used.

Therefore, the examples in this article use the one-to-many association `BookStore.books` and the many-to-many association `Book.authors`.

## Sorting Collection Associations  

:::caution
For collection type associations, if we use the field filter of [object fetchers](../../query/object-fetcher) to implement association-level sorting, it will cause Jimmer to ignore association cache.

To make full use of association cache while keeping the sorting of the associated object collection returned by the [object fetcher](../../query/object-fetcher) query controllable, you can specify the default sorting statically on the entity.

## Usage

As mentioned at the beginning of this article, the examples here are based on the one-to-many association `BookStore.books` and the many-to-many association `Book.authors`.

### One-to-Many: BookStore.books  

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookStoreTable table = Tables.BOOK_STORE_TABLE;
List<BookStore> stores = sqlClient
    .createQuery(table)
    .select(
        table.fetch(
            Fetchers.BOOK_STORE_FETCHER
                .allScalarFields()
                // highlight-next-line
                .books(
                    Fetchers.BOOK_FETCHER
                        .allScalarFields()
                )
        )
    )
    .execute();
System.out.println(stores);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin
val stores = sqlClient
    .createQuery(BookStore::class) {
        select(
            table.fetchBy {
                allScalarFields()
                // highlight-next-line
                books {
                    allScalarFields()
                }
            }
        )
    }
    .execute()
println(stores)
```

</Tabs>

-   Step 1: Query aggregate root

    First, query the aggregate root object, executing the following SQL:
    
    ```csharp
    select
        tb_1_.ID,
        tb_1_.NAME,
        tb_1_.WEBSITE
    from BOOK_STORE tb_1_
    ```

    The query in the code is implemented here to obtain some BookStore objects. Such objects obtained by direct user queries are called aggregate root objects.
    
    :::caution
    Jimmer does not cache aggregate objects returned by user queries, because the consistency of such query results cannot be guaranteed.

    Even if cache them at the cost of sacrificing consistency is required, it is a business need of the user rather than the framework.
    :::

-   Step 2: Convert current object id to associated object id via association cache

    The above code will return a series of aggregate root objects. If using the official sample data in the database, it will return two aggregate root objects.

    The object fetcher in the code contains the one-to-many association `BookStore.books`

    The primary keys `ID` of these 2 BOOK_STOREs are 1 and 2.
    
    Jimmer first looks up the data in Redis with keys `BookStore.books-1` and `BookStore.books-2`.

    Suppose the data corresponding to these keys cannot be found in Redis:
    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.books-*
    (empty array)
    ```

    So the following SQL is executed to load data from the database:
    ```csharp
    select
        tb_1_.STORE_ID,
        tb_1_.ID,
        tb_1_.NAME,
        tb_1_.EDITION,
        tb_1_.PRICE
    from BOOK tb_1_
    where
        tb_1_.STORE_ID in (
            ? /* 1 */, ? /* 2 */
        )
    order by
        tb_1_.NAME asc,
        tb_1_.EDITION desc
    ```

    Jimmer will put the results of the query into Redis, so we can view this data in Redis:
    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.books-*
    1) "BookStore.books-2"
    2) "BookStore.books-1"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get BookStore.books-1
    "[6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7]"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get BookStore.books-2
    "[12,11,10]" 
    127.0.0.1:6379>
    ```

    Thus, the two `BookStore` objects can obtain the associated object id collections of their respective one-to-many associations `BookStore.books`.

    Undoubtedly, before the data in Redis expires, executing the Java/Kotlin code above again will directly return the associated data from Redis without generating the second SQL statement.

-   Step 3: Convert associated object id to associated object via object cache

    Such operations have been discussed in detail in [Object Cache](./object), so they are not repeated here. This article focuses on association cache.

    :::caution
    In the cache configuration, if association cache is enabled for an association property but object cache is not enabled for its associated object type, an exception will be thrown.
    :::

:::info
Previously in [Object Fetcher](../../query/object-fetcher), we saw that Jimmer only needs one SQL statement to query all associated objects based on a batch of current objects, but here two SQL statements are needed, please view:

<ViewMore buttonText="The difference compared to not enabling cache">

# Cache Mode

In cache mode, this example has three execution steps:

1.  Query aggregate root from database

    Regardless of whether cache is enabled, this step is the same, no need to discuss.

2.  Based on the `BookStore.books` association cache, map the aggregate root object id to the associated object id

    If no related data exists in the cache, the following SQL will be executed:

    ```csharp
    select
        ...omit...
    from BOOK tb_1_ 
    where
        tb_1_.STORE_ID in (
            ? /* 1 */, ? /* 2 */
        )
    order by
        tb_1_.NAME asc,
        tb_1_.EDITION desc
    ```

3.  Based on the `Book` object cache, map the associated object id to the associated object

    If no related data exists in the cache, the following SQL will be executed:
    ```csharp 
    select
        ...omit...
    from BOOK tb_1_
    where
        tb_1_.ID in (
            ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,
            ?, ?, ?    
        )
    ```
# No Cache Mode

If association cache is not enabled, this query only needs two steps. The first step is exactly the same. The second step executes the following SQL query:

```csharp
select
    ...omit...
from BOOK tb_1_ 
where
    tb_1_.STORE_ID in (
        ? /* 1 */, ? /* 2 */
    )
order by
    tb_1_.NAME asc,
    tb_1_.EDITION desc
```

# Difference and Summary

No cache mode: Generate as few SQL statements as possible, make each SQL statement perform as many tasks as possible, such SQL has the best performance.

Cache mode: Does not aim to minimize the number of generated SQL statements. From the SQL point of view, the performance is not optimal, but combined with the cache system, the overall performance is optimal.

    The object fetcher in the code contains the many-to-many association `Book.authors`

    The primary keys `ID` of these 4 BOOKs are 1, 4, 7 and 10.

    Jimmer first looks up the data in Redis with keys `Book.authors-1`, `Book.authors-4`, `Book.authors-7` and `Book.authors-10`.

    Suppose the data corresponding to these keys cannot be found in Redis:

    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys Book.authors-*
    (empty array)
    ```

    So the following SQL is executed to load data from the database:

    ```csharp
    select
        tb_1_.BOOK_ID,
        tb_1_.AUTHOR_ID
    from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING tb_1_
    inner join AUTHOR tb_3_
        on tb_1_.AUTHOR_ID = tb_3_.ID
    where
        tb_1_.BOOK_ID in (
            ? /* 1 */, ? /* 4 */, ? /* 7 */, ? /* 10 */
        )
    order by
        tb_3_.FIRST_NAME asc,
        tb_3_.LAST_NAME asc
    ```

    :::note
    If no default sort is specified for the association property `Book.authors` via `@ManyToMany.orderedProps`, the `join` here will not appear.
    :::

    Jimmer will put the results of the query into Redis, so we can view this data in Redis:

    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys Book.authors-*
    1) "Book.authors-4"
    2) "Book.authors-1" 
    3) "Book.authors-10"
    4) "Book.authors-7"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get Book.authors-1
    "[2,1]"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get Book.authors-4
    "[3]"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get Book.authors-7
    "[4]"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get Book.authors-10
    "[5]"
    127.0.0.1:6379>
    ```

    Thus, we have obtained the associated object id collections that the 4 `Book` objects can get through their respective many-to-many association `Book.authors`.

    Undoubtedly, before the data in Redis expires, executing the Java/Kotlin code above again will directly return the associated data from Redis without generating the second SQL statement.

-   Step 3: Convert associated object id to associated object via object cache

    Such operations have been discussed in detail in [Object Cache](./object), so they are not repeated here. This article focuses on association cache.

    :::caution
    In the cache configuration, if association cache is enabled for an association property but object cache is not enabled for its associated object type, an exception will be thrown.
    :::

:::info
Previously in [Object Fetcher](../../query/object-fetcher), we saw that Jimmer only needs one SQL statement to query all associated objects based on a batch of current objects, but here two SQL statements are needed, please view:

<ViewMore buttonText="The difference compared to not enabling cache">

# Cache Mode

In cache mode, this example has three execution steps:

1.  Query aggregate root from database

    Regardless of whether cache is enabled, this step is the same, no need to discuss.

2.  Based on the `Book.authors` association cache, map the aggregate root object id to the associated object ids

    If no related data exists in the cache, the following SQL will be executed:

    ```csharp
    select
        tb_1_.BOOK_ID,
        tb_1_.AUTHOR_ID 
    from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING tb_1_
    inner join AUTHOR tb_3_
        on tb_1_.AUTHOR_ID = tb_3_.ID
    where
        tb_1_.BOOK_ID in (
            ? /* 1 */, ? /* 4 */, ? /* 7 */, ? /* 10 */
        )
    order by
        tb_3_.FIRST_NAME asc,
        tb_3_.LAST_NAME asc
    ```

3.  Based on the `Author` object cache, map the associated object ids to associated objects

    If no related data exists in the cache, the following SQL will be executed:

    ```csharp
    select
        tb_1_.ID,
        tb_1_.FIRST_NAME,
        tb_1_.LAST_NAME,
        tb_1_.GENDER
    from AUTHOR tb_1_
    where
        tb_1_.ID in (
            ? /* 2 */, ? /* 1 */, ? /* 4 */, ? /* 3 */, ? /* 5 */ 
        )
    ```

# No Cache Mode

If cache is not enabled, this query only needs two steps. The first step is exactly the same. The second step executes the following SQL query:

```csharp
select
    tb_2_.BOOK_ID,
    tb_1_.ID,
    tb_1_.FIRST_NAME,
    tb_1_.LAST_NAME,
    tb_1_.GENDER
from AUTHOR tb_1_
inner join BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING tb_2_
    on tb_1_.ID = tb_2_.AUTHOR_ID
where
    tb_2_.BOOK_ID in (
        ? /* 1 */, ? /* 4 */, ? /* 7 */, ? /* 10 */
    )
order by
    tb_1_.FIRST_NAME asc, 
    tb_1_.LAST_NAME asc
```

# Difference and Summary

No cache mode: Generate as few SQL statements as possible, make each SQL statement perform as many tasks as possible, such SQL has the best performance.

Cache mode: Does not aim to minimize the number of generated SQL statements. From the SQL point of view, the performance is not optimal, but combined with the cache system, the overall performance is optimal.

Finally, Jimmer concatenates the 3 steps results as the final data returned to the user:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Learning GraphQL", 
    "edition": 1,
    "price": 51,
    // highlight-next-line  
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 2,
        "firstName": "Alex",
        "lastName": "Banks", 
        "gender": "MALE"
      },
      {  
        "id": 1,
        "firstName": "Eve",
        "lastName": "Procello",
        "gender": "FEMALE"  
      }
    ]
  },

    "edition": 1,
    "price": 80, 
    // highlight-next-line
    "authors": [...omit...]
  }
]
```

## Cache Invalidation

:::caution
To use Jimmer's automatic cache invalidation, [triggers](../../mutation/trigger) need to be enabled first.
:::

### One-to-Many: BookStore.books

Modify the foreign key `STORE_ID` of the BOOK table, Jimmer automatically deletes the many-to-one association cache `Book.store` and the one-to-many association cache `BookStore.books`.

-   If BinLog trigger is enabled, modifying the database by any means can lead to Jimmer's cache consistency intervention. For example, directly execute the following SQL in the SQL IDE:

    ```csharp
    update BOOK
    /* Old value: 1, New value: 2 */
    set STORE_ID = 2
    where ID = 7;
    ```

-   If only Transaction trigger is enabled, Jimmer's API must be used to modify the database:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    BookTable table = Tables.BOOK_TABLE;
    sqlClient
        .createUpdate(table)
        // Old value: 1L, New value: 2L  
        .set(table.store().id, 2L)
        .where(table.id().eq(7L))
        .execute();
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    sqlClient
        .createUpdate(Book::class) {
            // Old value: 1L, New value: 2L
            set(table.store.id, 2L)
            where(table.id eq 7L)
        }
        .execute()
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Regardless of which way above is used to modify the data, you will see the following log output:

```
Delete data from redis: [Book-7]  
Delete data from redis: [Book.store-7] ❶
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.books-1] ❷
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.books-2] ❸
```

-   ❶ For the Book object with id `7`, its many-to-one association cache `Book.store` is deleted.
-   ❷ For the BookStore object with id `1` *(old value before modification)*, its one-to-many association cache `BookStore.books` is deleted. 
-   ❸ For the BookStore object with id `2` *(new value before modification)*, its one-to-many association cache `BookStore.books` is deleted.

### Many-to-Many: Book.authors

Inserting data into the join table `BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING` automatically deletes the many-to-many association caches `Book.authors` and `Author.books`.

:::note 
Deleting data from the join table can achieve the same effect. Here insertion is used to demonstrate the effect.
:::

-   If BinLog trigger is enabled, modifying the database by any means can lead to Jimmer's cache consistency intervention. For example, directly execute the following SQL in the SQL IDE:

    ```csharp
    insert into
    BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING(BOOK_ID, AUTHOR_ID) 
    values(10, 3);
    ```

-   If only Transaction trigger is enabled, Jimmer's API must be used to modify the database:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    
    ```java
    sqlClient
        .getAssociations(BookProps.AUTHORS)
        .save(10L, 3L);
    ```
    
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    
    ```kotlin
    sqlClient
        .getAssociations(Book::authors)
        .save(10L, 3L);
    ```
    
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Regardless of which way above is used to modify the data, you will see the following log output:

```  
Delete data from redis: [Book.authors-10] ❶
Delete data from redis: [Author.books-3] ❷
```

-   ❶ For the Book object with id `10`, its many-to-many association cache `Book.authors` is deleted.
-   ❷ For the Author object with id `3`, its many-to-many association cache `Author.books` is deleted.

## Notes on Logical Deletion

If associated objects support [logical deletion](../../query/global-filter/logical-deleted), association caching is still supported by default. 

:::warning
However, once the logical deletion is [ignored](../../query/global-filter/logical-deleted#ignore-logical-deletion-filter) or [reversed](../../query/global-filter/logical-deleted#reverse-logical-deletion-filter), association caching will be ignored.
