## Non-Structural Design Example  

Through the content related to [Association Mapping](../base/association), it is not difficult to find that all associations are based on `@JoinColumn` and `@JoinTable` *(may be omitted)*.

Although Jimmer supports fake foreign keys *(foreign keys in the developer's mind but without corresponding foreign key constraints in the database)*, all the association mappings we have discussed so far are based on 3NF design of relational databases.

However, you may be handed over a legacy database containing non-normalized database designs, such as:

```csharp
create table book(
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    // highlight-next-line 
    author_ids varchar(100),
    ...Omit other columns...
) engine=innodb;
```

Here, `author_ids` is a string column whose data is the ids of all `Author` objects associated with the current `Book` concatenated together with commas, e.g. `1, 5, 100, 206`. 

Obviously, this is a non-structural design that does not satisfy 3NF of relational databases.

:::note
For Postgres that supports array types, using arrays would be a better choice, but for better generality of this example, string concatenation is still used here without utilizing database-specific features.
::: 

## Non-Structural Association

To support such non-structural designs, Jimmer provides the `@org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.JoinSql` annotation.

:::info
`@JoinSql` must and can only be used together with `@ManyToMany`.
:::

Next, create an SQL function *(MySQL is used as example here)*:

```csharp
create function concatenation_string_contains(
	self varchar(100),
	id bigint  
) returns boolean
begin
	if self is null then
		return false;
	end if;
	return self regexp concat('(^|\\,)\\s*', id, '\\s*(\\,|$)'); 
end;
```

This function assumes that the parameter `self` is in the format of multiple numbers concatenated by commas, and determines whether it contains the parameter `id`. For example:

-   `concatenation_string_contains('100, 200, 300', 200)` returns true

-   `concatenation_string_contains('100, 200, 300', 201)` returns false

Now we can map the non-structural many-to-many association:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java" 
@Entity
public interface Book {

    @ManyToMany
    // highlight-next-line
    @JoinSql(
        "concatenation_string_contains(" +
        "    %alias.author_ids, " +
        "    %target_alias.id" + 
        ")"
    )
    List<Author> authors();

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    @ManyToMany
    // highlight-next-line
    @JoinSql(
        "concatenation_string_contains(" +
        "    %alias.author_ids, " + 
        "    %target_alias.id" +
        ")"
    )
    val authors: List<Author>

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The SQL expression used in `@JsonSql` represents the join condition, where:

-   `concatenation_string_contains`: The SQL function we defined earlier

-   `%alias`: A special token defined by Jimmer representing the alias of the current table *(`book` table in this example)*

-   `%target_alias`: A special token defined by Jimmer representing the alias of the target table *(`author` table in this example)* 

:::caution
ORM automatically generates SQL *(which is very important for dynamic queries, especially for ORMs like Jimmer that first proposed the [Dynamic Join](../../query/dynamic-join) concept)*, and users cannot interfere with the aliases of tables in the final SQL.

So using `%alias` and `%target_alias` here is the only way.
:::

It is worth mentioning that if you want to define a bidirectional many-to-many association, since `Book.authors` has already used `@JoinSql`, the other end `Author.books` does not need to use `@JoinSql` again. As before, use `mappedBy` to indicate that it is the inverse property.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Author.java"
@Entity
public interface Author {

    // highlight-next-line
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "authors")
    List<Book> books();

    ...Omit other code... 
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Author.kt"
@Entity
interface Author {

    // highlight-next-line
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "authors")
    val books: List<Book>

    ...Omit other code...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Precautions

:::warning
Unless legacy database compatibility is required, do not perform non-structural design and map it with `@JoinSql`, because non-structural many-to-many associations have many limitations:

-   Cannot be used as [Remote Association](./remote)

-   Cannot participate in [Dynamic Join Optimization](../../query/dynamic-join/optimization) 

-   Cannot use [Association Cache](../../cache/cache-type/association)

-   Cannot be saved as part of data structure by [Save Command](../../mutation/save-command). In fact, if the data structure to be saved contains non-structural associations, it will cause exceptions.
