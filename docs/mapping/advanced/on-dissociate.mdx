## Concepts

@`org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.OnDissociate` is used together with [Modification/Save Command](../../mutation/save-command) and [Modification/Delete Command](../../mutation/delete-command)

- [Modification/Save Command](../../mutation/save-command)

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Existing data structure in database</th>
    <th>Data structure expected to be saved by user</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>

    ```sh
    +-BookStore(id=2)
    |
    +-----Book(id=10)
    |
    # highlight-next-line
    +-----Book(id=11) 
    |
    # highlight-next-line
    \-----Book(id=12)

    
    ```

    </td>
    <td>

    ```sh
    +-BookStore(id=2)
    |
    +-----Book(id=10)
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    \-----Book(id=9)
    ```

    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    This means:

    - The association between `BookStore-2` and `Book-10` remains unchanged

    - The association between `BookStore-2` and `Book-9` needs to be created

    - `BookStore-2` needs to be disassociated from `Book-11` and `Book-12`.

- [Modification/Delete Command](../../mutation/delete-command)

    This is easy to understand. Child objects need to be disassociated before deleting the parent object.

`@OnDissociate` can only be used on foreign key based many-to-one associations, for example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">  

```java title="Book.java"
@Entity
public interface Book {

    @Null
    @ManyToOne
    // highlight-next-line  
    @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.SET_NULL)
    BookStore store();
    ...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Book.kt" 
@Entity
interface Book {

    @ManyToOne
    // highlight-next-line
    @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.SET_NULL) 
    val store: BookStore?
    ...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Although disassociation of child objects is caused by a one-to-many association *(or inverse one-to-one)* *(that is, the parent object abandons some child objects. The one-to-many association here is `BookStore.books`)*, the disassociation mode is configured for the inverse many-to-one association *(here `Book.store`)*. This design is to maintain similarity with configuring cascade properties of foreign keys in database DDLs.

For Jimmer, a one-to-many association must be bidirectional, so the many-to-one association that is the mirror image of a known one-to-many association is always known. So there is no problem with this design.

## Dissociation Modes

The parameter of the `OnDissociate` annotation in the above code is called the dissociation mode:

<DissociateMode/>

This article only introduces the configuration of OnDissociate. For how to use it further, please refer to [Save Command/Dissociation Operations](../../mutation/save-command/association/dissociation) and [Delete Commands](../../mutation/delete-command).

## Dynamic Overrides 

Configuration specified by the annotation `@OnDissociate` is called static configuration.

Sometimes, different businesses may have different requirements for dissociation operations. Therefore, dissociation configurations can be dynamically overridden at runtime.
