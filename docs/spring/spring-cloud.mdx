title: Remote Associations

Remote associations are Jimmer's first thoughts on microservice architecture.

Through vertical splitting, entity types can be divided into different microservices, or in other words, divided into different databases. The associations *(including one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many)* between entity types belonging to different microservices are remote associations.

:::tip
Jimmer automatically implements automatic query of remote associated data. 

That is, if the [object fetcher](../query/object-fetcher) contains remote association properties of any depth, it will query different parts of the data across multiple microservices, and finally merge the query results of different parts into the data structure expected by the object fetcher as a whole return. No need for developers to implement remote queries and data splicing themselves.
:::

## Databases

In this article, each entity is divided as follows:

<Cloud/>

:::info
-   `BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING` as the many-to-many association intermediate table, can be divided into either the `book-service` service or the `author-service` service. In this example, it is divided into the `book-service` service, the reason will be explained later.

-   Solid arrows indicate foreign key references within the same database, whose validity can be freely chosen by developers. 

-   Dashed arrows indicate foreign key references across database boundaries, which must be pseudo foreign keys.

To simplify the discussion, the database initialization scripts for the three services are as follows:

## Entity Definition 

In a separate subproject *(the accompanying examples are
[jimmer-examples/java/jimmer-cloud/model](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/tree/main/java/jimmer-cloud/model) or
[jimmer-examples/kotlin/jimmer-cloud-kt/model](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/tree/main/kotlin/jimmer-cloud-kt/model))*, define all entity types.

These entity types constitute the global model. Entity types belong to different microservices. Entities between different microservices constitute remote associations, which can actually be understood as the interaction contracts between entities belonging to different microservices.

-   The `microServiceName` of the `@Entity` annotation of the entity class is specified, so that it is clear which microservice each entity belongs to, i.e. which database.

    In this example, the entity types `BookStore`, `Book` and `Author` belong to the services `store-service`, `book-service` and `author-service` respectively.

    Here the microservice is the name of each service in the registry center, for spring-cloud it is the global configuration `spring.application.name`.

-   The associations between entities belonging to different microservices are remote associations.

    -   `BookStore.books` and `Book.store`: `BookStore` belongs to `store-service`, while `Book` belongs to `book-service`

    -   `Book.authors` and `Author.books`: `Book` belongs to `book-service`, while `Author` belongs to `author-service`

-   The many-to-one association `Book.store` must be nullable, because the remote association means its foreign key must reference data in another database, that is, it must be a pseudo foreign key. And in Jimmer, the field corresponding to a pseudo foreign key must be nullable.

    Please refer to [Real and Pseudo Foreign Keys](../mapping/base/foreignkey).

-   For the bidirectional many-to-many association between books and authors, `Book.authors` is the owning side, while `Author.books` is the inverse side *(`mappedBy` of `@ManyToMany` is configured)*.

    :::info
    Jimmer stipulates that the intermediate table of remote associations must belong to the microservice where the owning side entity belongs.
    :::

    Here the question left in the previous section is answered, why in this example the intermediate table `BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING` is defined in the `book-service` database instead of the `author-service` database.

## Registry Center

Microservice applications need a registry center, which is a basic feature of microservice architecture, no explanation is needed in this article.

In the accompanying examples, it is [jimmer-examples/java/jimmer-cloud/registry-center](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/blob/main/java/jimmer-cloud/registry-center)
or [jimmer-examples/kotlin/jimmer-cloud-kt/registry-center](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/blob/main/kotlin/jimmer-cloud-kt/registry-center)

## Implementing Services 

Since the implementations of the microservices `store-service`, `book-service` and `author-service` are highly similar, this document only explains how to implement `store-service`.

:::note
Although this document only explains `store-service`, to experience the effect of remote associations, all three services need to be fully implemented.

Complete code can be found in the accompanying examples [jimmer-examples/java/jimmer-cloud](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/blob/main/java/jimmer-cloud)
or [jimmer-examples/kotlin/jimmer-cloud-kt](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples/blob/main/kotlin/jimmer-cloud-kt).

### Enable Microservice Support in Jimmer

Any microservice must enable Jimmer's microservice support. There are two ways:

-   Use Spring Boot Starter

    Modify spring configuration file `application.yml` *(or `application.properties`)*

    ```sh
    spring:
        application:
        # highlight-next-line
            name: store-service

    jimmer:
    # highlight-next-line
        micro-service-name: ${spring.application.name}
    ...other configurations omitted...

    eureka:
        client:
            serviceUrl:
                defaultZone: http://localhost:7000/eureka/
    ```

    Here, "store-service" is used both as the name of the current service in spring-cloud registry center and as the microservice configuration in Jimmer.
  
-   When using low-level APIs

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    JSqlClient sqlClient = JSqlClient
        .newBuilder()
        .setMicroServiceName("...")
        ...other configurations omitted...
        .build();
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    val sqlClient = newKSqlClient {
        setMicroServiceName("...")
        ...other configurations omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Once `jimmer.micro-service-name` is configured, Jimmer knows which entity types belong to the current service *(here is `BookStore`)*. 

-   Using Jimmer's ORM APIs to operate on the entity types belonging to the current microservice will execute correctly, just like everything explained in previous documents.

-   Using Jimmer's ORM APIs to operate on entity types belonging to other microservices will throw exceptions.

:::tip
As long as each service ensures `spring.application.name` and `jimmer.micro-service-name` are the same, Jimmer will automatically implement automatic query of remote associated data without requiring developers to write any code.

### Implement Business Query Logic

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="BookStoreService.java"
@GetMapping("/store/{id}/detail")
public @FetchBy("COMPLEX_FETCHER") BookStore findStoreDetail(
        @PathVariable("id") long id
) {
    return storeRepository.findNullable(id, COMPLEX_FETCHER); 
}

public static final Fetcher<BookStore> COMPLEX_FETCHER =
    Fetchers.BOOK_STORE_FETCHER ❶
        .allScalarFields()
        .books( ❷
            Fetchers.BOOK_FETCHER
                .allScalarFields()
                .authors( ❸
                    Fetchers.AUTHOR_FETCHER
                        .allScalarFields()
                )
        );
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="BookStoreService.kt"
@GetMapping("/store/{id}/detail")
fun findStoreDetail(
    @PathVariable("id") id: Long  
): @FetchBy("COMPLEX_FETCHER") BookStore? =
    storeRepository.findNullable(id, COMPLEX_FETCHER)

companion object {

    val COMPLEX_FETCHER =  
        newFetcher(BookStore::class).by { ❶
            allScalarFields()
            books { ❷
                allScalarFields()
                authors { ❸
                    allScalarFields()
                }
            }
        }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

-   ❶ Query root aggregate, queried directly from the database belonging to the current service `store-service`

-   ❷ Query associated objects through remote association property `BookStore.books`

    Access remote microservice `book-service` indirectly to get data via HTTP protocol

-   ❸ Query associated objects through remote association property `Book.authors`

    Access remote microservice `author-service` indirectly to get data via HTTP protocol
  
:::tip
Users only need to implement queries for root aggregate objects, queries for associated properties *(including remote associations)* are fully automated by Jimmer.

Therefore, even without writing any Java/Kotlin code for the other two microservices `book-service` and `author-service`, as long as their configuration files are modified to support microservices, this method can still run correctly.
:::

### Run Effects

Assuming `store-service` is started on localhost with port 7001, accessing `http://localhost:7001/store/1/detail` will get the result:
