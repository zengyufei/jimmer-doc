Implicit subqueries can only be used for collection associations. This article discusses implicit subqueries through the many-to-many `Book.authors`.

## Usage

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Nullable String authorName = ...Omitted...;
@Nullable Gender authorGender = ...Omitted...;

BookTable table = BookTable.$;
List<Book> books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(table)
    .where(
        table.authors(author -> ❶
            Predicate.or(
                author.firstName().ilikeIf(authorName),
                author.lastName().ilikeIf(authorName)
            )
        ) 
    ) 
    .where(
        table.authors(author -> ❷
            author.gender().eqIf(authorGender)
        )
    ) 
    .select(table)
    .execute();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val authorName: String? = ...Omitted...
val authorGender: Gender? = ...Omitted...

val books = sqlClient
    .createQuery(Book::class) {
        where += table.authors { ❶
            or(
                firstName `ilike?` authorName,
                lastName `ilike?` authorName
            )
        }
        where += table.authors { ❷
            gender `eq?` authorGender
        }
        select(table)
    }
    .execute()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In fact, the two implicit subqueries in the code above can be merged into one, but in order to better demonstrate in the following text, they are deliberately written as two.

## Various Situations

### All subqueries are invalid

If both `authorName` and `authorGender` are null, it will cause the subqueries created at ❶ and ❷ to be invalid, and no actual SQL subqueries will be rendered.

At this time, the following SQL is generated:

```csharp
select
    tb_1_.ID,
    tb_1_.NAME,
    tb_1_.EDITION,
    tb_1_.PRICE,
    tb_1_.STORE_ID
from BOOK tb_1_
```

### Some subqueries take effect 

If `authorName` is specified as non-null while `authorGender` remains null, the subquery at ❶ takes effect, while the subquery at ❷ is ignored.  

At this time, the following SQL is generated:

```csharp
select
    tb_1_.ID,
    tb_1_.NAME,
    tb_1_.EDITION,
    tb_1_.PRICE,
    tb_1_.STORE_ID
from BOOK tb_1_
where
    exists(
        select
            1
        from AUTHOR tb_2_
        inner join BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING tb_3_
            on tb_2_.ID = tb_3_.AUTHOR_ID
        where
                tb_3_.BOOK_ID = tb_1_.ID
            and
                (
                    lower(tb_2_.FIRST_NAME) like ? /* %a% */
                or
                    lower(tb_2_.LAST_NAME) like ? /* %a% */
                )
    )
```

### All subqueries take effect

If both `authorName` and `authorGender` are specified as non-null, the implicit subqueries created at ❶ and ❷ will both take effect.   

:::tip
Jimmer can automatically merge conflicting implicit subqueries. The two implicit subqueries will be merged into one implicit subquery. 
Ultimately, only one SQL subquery will be rendered.

                or
                    lower(tb_2_.LAST_NAME) like ? /* %a% */
                )
            and
                tb_2_.GENDER = ? /* M */
    )
```
